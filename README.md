API Challenge

Brian Guenther

Is a two part challenge, with the first element focused on OpenWeatherMap API and the second element on Geoapify API.

1) WeatherPy was completed based on notes from class activities.  However when I moved on to using this data for the second part of the assignment (VacationPy), I discovered a typo in the code such that I had latitude values substituted for the longitude values.  This was corrected and the program was done again, which altered my analysis of the outputs.

Vacation Py â€“ Discussed the project in broader terms with the tutor.  Additional information obtained from the following sources:

Review of Pandas DF copy at
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.copy.html  

Information for nearest hotel by review of inclass activities and 
https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/places/#about 

For modifying hover information, I spent too much time trying to modify geoapify (for example at links like)

Realized data was extracted from Geoapify and I was working within Hvplot of Python and then found this guide to a solution.
